# Radwords User Manual 

Welcome to the official documentation of the R Adwords package for Google Adwords. Radwords enables users of the R Language for Statistical Computing to directly access their Google Adwords account in order to consume and analyze information provided by the Adwords API.

## General

Radwords is a license cost free open source project by [@jburkhardt](https://github.com/jburkhardt) and [@mbannert](https://github.com/jburkhardt).
Our package implements three main features:

**First**, the package provides OAUTH2 authentication for R with an user's Google Adwords account. 

**Second**, the package offers an R interface to apply the Adwords Query Language from within R. The Adwords API can be used to obtain adhoc reports. 

**Third**, the received data is transformed to standard R data objects that can be easily analyzed from within R or export to standard file formats.
