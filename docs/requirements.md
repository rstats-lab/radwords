- AdWords API Developer Token


Missing one of the above mentioned items you cannot access the AdWords API.

### Google API Project

Set up a [Google API project](https://console.developers.google.com) for **native apps**. The Google API project provides a **Client Id** and **Client Secret** which is necessary for the authentication.

### Adwords MCC

Moreover you need to have a Adwords MCC. A single AdWords account is not sufficient.
